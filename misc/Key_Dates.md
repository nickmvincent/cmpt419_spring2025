# Week 6 Onwards

This document contains a summary of all remaining key dates for the rest of the term.

I'll also try to also clarify here the relevant Week Number and day of the week.

For our purposes, Mon Feb 10 begins "Week 6". Week 7 begins Feb 17, but we have no class -- it is "consumed" by Reading Week.

## Key Dates
