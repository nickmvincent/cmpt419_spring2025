"An erratum or corrigendum (pl.: errata, corrigenda) (comes from Latin: errata corrige) is a correction of a published text" (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erratum)).

In this doc, I'll record any meaningful typos in materials or answers to questions to that may have caused confusion.

In Spring 2025, I started this doc on Feb 12


## Week 6

- Feb 11
  - Minor: Several typos in slides, see this [commit](https://github.com/nickmvincent/cmpt419_spring2025/commit/ff0bf6be48f78ccd355aacf92a53738f38cb506c) if curious
  - Substantive: in lecture, my explanation of the denominator used when calculating Shapley values was a bit confusing. I compeltely reworked these slides to provide a clearer example where have 10 rows (n=10) and we consider all the "coalitions" of size 9, then of size 8, then of size 7...
  - Substantive: in lecture, I went very quickly when describing the desirable economic properties of the Shapley value. If curious (and especially if you might be taking or will take econ courses that use Shapley values, see e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value). I'll also revisit this with some examples on Thursday.)
