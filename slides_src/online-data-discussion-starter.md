## Running out of Data?

Broad q: If tech companies have already "scraped all they can", are we going to see an "AI Winter"?

## Background on AI winter

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter


## Ongoing debate about "synthetic data"


What is synthetic data, exactly?

- My (current) take: "synthetic" is underspecified; source and generating model matter (not a particularly hot take)
- This is a very rapdily changing area!


## Licensing to use data

- What do companies do now?
- What will they do in the next 1 to $x$ months as lawsuits resolve?
- What should they do?

## Prompt:

What do *you* prefer for *your data*?

## Licensing and individual consent

- What are key differences between a licensing-focused approach and a consent-focused approach?

## Why pay for Reddit data

- Relates to previous question...
- Reddit has taken action to make scraping harder. And Google is gambling that paying might be better than getting sued in the future.
- Connects with another FAQ...


## A shift towards private data?

- Will AI development return to a status quo in which all the "advantage" is extracted from private, secret datasets?

## Conceptual issues with data dividends

- Counterproductive to collective action?
- Old critiques of UBI?

## Data strikes

- How would they actually work?
- When will they actually work?
