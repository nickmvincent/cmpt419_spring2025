<p>The goal of the week 2 readings is to begin getting some exposure to what different researchers mean when they refer to human and data centered ML/AI. We want to start developing some intuiton for when human-centered practices or data-centred thinking might materially change how we design a system, come up with a research question, or deploy a model.</p>

<h3 id="response-instructions">Response Instructions:</h3>
<p>1) Please write one to two paragraphs describing why you’d like to work on, or with, ML/AI systems? You can imagine these paragraphs as text you might include in a cover letter.<br />
2) Please list 1-3 “domains of interest” (e.g., social media, content recommendation, law, health care, mental health, the environment, economics). They can be at any level of granularity (e.g. “AI for health” is OK, as is “AI for oncology”). Similarly to part 1, the purpose of this is to help me identify trends in your interests so I can suggest optional readings that are of interest to you and your classmates!</p>
<p>If you submit any reasonable formatted submission for this reading response, you&rsquo;ll receive full credit. In future response instructions, you might see something along the lines of, &ldquo;you must quote on of the readings directly to support your point&rdquo;).</p>
<p>For this reading response, you&rsquo;ll submit via CourSys.</p>
<p>Optional reading<br />

<h2 id="week-3">Week 3</h2>
<p>The goal of the week 3 reading is to gain further exposure to various frameworks put forward around focusing on humans (Schneiderman reading) and/or data (Sambasivan et al reading and Zha et al reading).</p>
<p>Note this week is a bit longer than than Week 2. We&rsquo;ll check in on how it&rsquo;s going, workflow wise, to complete these readings, and focus on challenges that may come up for those who haven&rsquo;t had many reading heavy computing classes previously.</p>

<h3 id="response-instructions_1">Response Instructions</h3>
<p>Imagine you are a manager at a large tech company tasked with developing a new AI product. You can pick one of the following three options based on your interests, or suggest your own product:</p>
<ul>
<li>A large language model that will read physician notes and make suggestions about how to treat patients</li>
<li>A recommender system for a video-based content app</li>
<li>A facial recognition system that will be sold via API credits</li>
</ul>
<p>Q1: Thought experiment: Please write 1-2 paragraphs describing how adopting any of the suggestions from any of this week’s readings might change your product features (first define the product). Please directly reference (e.g. directly quote) one or more of the readings.</p>
<p>Q2: Please list three examples of “harms” that might occur from a failure to do “data work” as defined in the Sambasivan reading. You can use the same AI product you picked for Q1, or discuss one or more different AI products. You don’t need to quote the reading directly for this part.</p>
<p>Q3: Quick retrieval question: According to Zha et al., what category would each of the following techniques fall into: feature selection, creating images with randomly occluded patches, using Mechanical Turk to label documents.</p>
<p>Q4: Please let me know roughly how the long the readings and responses took so we can calibrate!</p>
<h2 id="week-4">Week 4</h2>
<p>For this week, there will be just two readings. The goal this week is still to gain exposure to all the different frameworks for thinking that motivate &ldquo;human-centered AI&rdquo; and &ldquo;data-centered AI&rdquo;. Last week, we saw several more frameworks, and in particular learned more about specific &ldquo;data-centric&rdquo; task formulations.</p>
<p>In our first reading, Chancellor highlighted that human-centered ML is often tied deeply to specific goals around fairness, justice, and values. This week, we&rsquo;ll dive into this with a reading from a textbook.</p>
<p>This week we&rsquo;ll just read two pieces: one is a longer introduction to a fairness in ML textbook, and the other is the Introduction to another research paper.</p>
<p>Please read the Introduction of FairML: https://fairmlbook.org/introduction.html</p>
<ul>
<li>While our course material will differ in some ways from a Special Topics course that&rsquo;s entirely focused on fair ML, there&rsquo;s quite a bit of conceptual overlap between being human-centered and trying to achieve some notion of fairness.</li>
<li>For our purposes, the concept of the &ldquo;machine learning loop&rdquo;, and especially measurements and going &ldquo;from data to models&rdquo; will be highly salient to almost all the topics we discuss, so try to read this one closely! We&rsquo;ll discuss this quite a bit together in class as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read the Introduction of “Value-Sensitive Algorithm Design: Method, Case Study, and Lessons” by Zhu et al, published in CSCW: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274463 </p>
<p>The goal of this reading is to see another example of how a research project might concretely seek to incorporate values into design. You don&rsquo;t need to read the full paper, though if you&rsquo;re particularly interested in working on algorithm design you might want to!</p>
<h3 id="response-instructions_2">Response Instructions:</h3>
<p>Q1: Please summarize in your own words the idea of the &ldquo;machine learning loop&rdquo;. Do your best to capture the key concepts from the FairML intro.</p>
<p>Q2: How does the discussion of feedback loops in FairML Introduction compare to the discussion of feedback in Schneiderman&rsquo;s HCAI? You can just write 2-3 sentences describing major differences or similarities you see. There&rsquo;s not a correct answer here.</p>
<p>Q3: Quick retrieval: What online platform do Zhu et al. use to study value-sensitive design in a real-world setting?</p>
<p>Q4: Please let me know roughly how the long the readings and responses took so I can continue to calibrate!</p>
<h2 id="week-5">Week 5</h2>
<p>This week, we are going to start reading a long piece that surveys training data influence:<br />
Training Data Influence Analysis and Estimation: A Survey, Zayd Hammoudeh, Daniel Lowd: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04612</p>
<p>This piece will represent a large jump from reading about high-level frameworks that consider social factors, incentives, etc. to a much more mathematical framework for thinking about data-centricity. Accordingly, we&rsquo;re going to work through this piece (and some excerpts from the key citations) fairly slowly. For this week, you should just read pages 1-10 (on the arxiv version &ndash; up to Section 4).</p>
<p>For this week&rsquo;s reading responses, you do not need to answer any questions. Instead, please use the reading response as a chance to record any questions that come up (if you want to just ask them in lecture, that&rsquo;s great too!)</p>
<h2 id="week-6">Week 6</h2>
<p>This week we will continue reading the Hammoudeh and Lowd survey.</p>
<p>Please read pages 10-21 (up to Section 5.1.2, &ldquo;Representer Point Methods&rdquo;).</p>
<p>For your response, please answer the following 3 questions:</p>
<p>Q1) Please describe the difference between a leave one out influence value and a Shapley value, in the context of training data influence.</p>
<p>Q2) What is the main issue with calculating retraining-based data values, as described in our reading?</p>
<p>Q3) If you were asked to run a new data market that makes use of influence estimates, which approach from the reading would you use and why? There is no correct answer to question, but you should aim to think through some of the trade-offs.</p>
<h2 id="week-7-reading-week">Week 7 (Reading Week)</h2>
<p>This week, please read: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00409.pdf</p>
<p>For your response, please answer the following 3 questions:</p>
<p>Q1) Please describe the consistent finding across all ML domains in this study.</p>
<p>Q2) What are the three &ldquo;learning regions&rdquo; that the authors identify?</p>
<p>Q3) About how long did this reading take?</p>
<p>The reading response for this week will be due Week 8 (i.e., two responses due Week 8!)</p>
<h2 id="week-8">Week 8</h2>
<p>This week, we&rsquo;re going to start talking about online platforms and their role a key AI training data source. We&rsquo;ll orient much of our discussion around recent advances in Large Language Models, but with the caveat that the core ideas are equally relevant to search, recommendation, and classification systems in many applied domains of interest to our class (e.g. medicine, analytics for sports and games).</p>
<p>First, please read these two short blog posts from 2020 and 2022.</p>
<p>https://dataleverage.substack.com/p/dont-give-openai-all-the-credit-for</p>
<p>https://dataleverage.substack.com/p/chatgpt-is-awesome-and-scary-you-deserve-credit</p>
<p>Next, please read Sections 1 and 2 of this pre-print paper:</p>
<p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027</p>
<p>For this week, please list three specific online platforms that are useful for AI training.</p>
