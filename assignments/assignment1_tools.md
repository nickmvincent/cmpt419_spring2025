You will submit a short report on your tool-related exploration as your first "coding assignment".

You don't need to submit any particular code, but after you've completed this report you're encouraged to try out a "practice run" with the tools you've selected. For instance, you might try spending 30-60 minutes on a quick "side project", and make sure you're able to complete it, produce an output file, etc.

After you’ve spent some time exploring tools, please submit via Canvas a report which describes your answers to the following questions. You can submit as a PDF file or in plaintext as a .md file. Please organize your answers in terms of question numbers, as indicated below. It’s perfectly OK if some of your answers are very short!

Your choices are not binding -- this primarily to get you thinking about these choices early on and to encourage you to explore some of the available options before additional assignments are due.

Q1: Which tools you plan to use for writing code (IDE, AI assistance, version control). e.g. answers might include: VS Code, Sublime text, ChatGPT, Copilot, GitHub

Q2: What open questions or concerns do you have about code writing tools?

Q3: Which ML libraries / frameworks / tools do you have familiarity with already?

Q4: If given the choice, which ML libraries do you prefer to use for any assignments that involve training and evaluating a ML model?

Q5: Which ML libraries / frameworks / tools do you hope to learn more about (“I’m not sure, that’s why I’m taking this class” is an OK answer!)

Q6: Which tools you plan to use to read and take notes on papers, if any (pen + paper or PDF reader + notes app is perfectly fine answer!)

Q7: Which tools, if any, you plan to use for project management?
