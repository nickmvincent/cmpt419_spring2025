# Week 6 Onwards

This document contains a summary of all remaining key dates for the rest of the term.

I'll also try to also clarify here the relevant Week Number and day of the week.

For our purposes, Mon Feb 10 begins "Week 6". Week 7 begins Feb 17, but we have no class -- it is "consumed" by Reading Week.

## Key Dates (Quiz 2, Assignment 2, Project Proposal, Assignment 3, Quiz 3)

- Quiz 2: Feb 27th 12:30pm (Thursday of Week 8. Assignment 2 should help you study for this, so don't leave it for the last minute).
  - On paper, in class, first 30 mins. No notes, but some standardized "cheat sheet" will be provided (with e.g. table of time complexities for influence estimators).
  - Make-up details TBA, please try not to miss it.
