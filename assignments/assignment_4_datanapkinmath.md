# Assignment 4

DEADLINE (Spring 2025): April 3, 23:59

Assignment 4 will be short and open-ended.

For this assignment, you should visit https://nickmvincent.github.io/data_napkin_math/

You will produce a short report (1 page OK, more also OK) that describes some data napkin math estimation about your *project data*.

Please assess, to the best of your ability:
- How many hours of human labour were required to create the dataset you are using for your project?
- How much money would it cost to "commission" a fresh copy of this dataset (hint: use your hours estimate and make a reasonable guess about hourly costs)
- How much money could this dataset generate (hint: make a reasonable guess about this data could be used to make inferences, predictions, detections etc. and what the business value or other value is. The answer might be: not very much!)

You will need to write down a lot of assumptions. You will marked based on your completeness in listing and justifying the assumptions, not the empirical validity of your estimate (i.e., it is better to make wild guesses than to have unexplained details).

If you are in a project group, you may submit this with your group (will be a "Group Assignment" in CourSys).
