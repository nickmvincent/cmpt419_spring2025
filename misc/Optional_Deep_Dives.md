## Deep Dives on Influence


- https://openreview.net/forum?id=hzbguA9zMJ: revisits influence functions in neural networks. It offers additional insight into how the influence function derivation aligns (or doesn’t) with leave‑one‑out retraining: 
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08297: examines the accuracy of influence function approximations for deep networks and discusses the role of the Hessian inversion—helpful for checking the assumptions behind the derivations.
