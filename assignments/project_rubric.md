# Project Rubric

Here, you will find detailed instructions for the class project.

This document assumes you've read the details in the Project Proposal.

### **When is the project due?**

The official project deadline is **April 3 23:59**.

You are encouraged to finish a draft of your project report before the end of the semester. You will have an opportunity to present your project. This is voluntarily but operates under the "it can only help you" rule: if your presentation helps to clarify the contributions or challenges of your project, this may positively affect your grade. In particular, presenting your project can help you increase your "relevance to class themes" score, as I will ask questions and give you a chance to further demonstrate engagement with our key themes.

Furthermore, if you give a presentation, you can opt out of Quiz 4. If you give a presentation that does not meet the quality bar, I will inform you afterwards and can take Quiz 4 (so you will not "risk" anything by giving a presentation).

If you believe you can make major improvements with some extra time, you can write an "extension" plan **at least a week in advance** (detailing how your group will use the following time (between 1-6 days, with April 9 23:59 being the absolute, final, no exceptions, deadline). This should be structured much like an email or presentation you might give your boss explaining why a feature needs an extra week of dev time (something that may happen in your career!)

Even if you ask for an extension, you must submit a draft of your report on April 3rd.

### **How is the class project graded?**

Group-based scaling: I've mentioned in class that larger groups will have higher overall expectations for what the project accomplishes.

In practice, this will be implemented based on an assessment of "overall contribution" and based on your report's "contribution statements". You should describe what everyone did and provide evidence that everyone did something. When I assess your output artifact, I will write a “contribution summary” myself with *my understanding* of what everyone did. If your artifact lacks the details for me to do this, you will lose marks\!

More concretely, we will use the following rubric/process to assign grades to the projects. Remember that a goal of the highly flexible project "tracks" is so that you can make something that will look good on your portfolio based on your own career or personal interests. This will be a motivating theme in grading \-- could the project impress a potential employer? Will I be excited to share your output artifacts with my colleagues?

You are expected to do some degree of self or collaborative learning as part of the project. You may need to try out libraries we didn't use directly during class time or read work that wasn't assigned. If you are *only* engaging with strictly required course materials, this is enough for our quizzes, but probably not be enough for the project.

#### **Report Rubric**

You will submit a report, which will be structured much like an academic paper.

This includes the following components

| Category | Points (%) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Abstract | 2 points (5%) |
| Visual Abstract | 2 points (5%) |
| Introduction | 4 points (10%) |
| Related Work | 4 points (10%) |
| Methods | 4 points (10%) |
| Results | 4 points (10%) |
| Discussion | 8 points (20%) |
| Connection to class themes | 4 points (20%) |
| Overall artifact quality | 8 points (40%) |

Total: 40 points

The idea behind having each section be some multiple of 2 is because the "marking scheme" for each section will roughly follow some kind of 0 = bad, 1 = reasonable, 2 = good breakdown. More details follow:

**Abstract: 2 points**

Summarize the key contribution of your project. It should be understandable to all of your classmates, and at least partially understandable to your peers from across a variety of disciplines.

Marking scheme: 2/2 for clear concise project that explains what your project does and why you were motivated to do it. 1/2 for an abstract that is difficult to read, is vague, or doesn't motivate the work. 0/2 for an abstract that is very vague.

**Visual Abstract: 2 points**

Create a figure or diagram that summarizes the key contribution of your project.

You can imagine this as a slide in your slide deck with key themes from your abstract. You might show some kind of feedback loop or a basic architectural diagram.

Same marking scheme as abstract.

**Introduction: 4 points**

State the problem your project solves, which might mean answering a research question (Track 1), providing some value to users (Track 2), or answering a dataset documentation question (Track 3). You should cite some motivating work and situate your project disciplinarily. Who is your audience? You should look at the Introductions of the research papers we read in class to get a sense of the appropriate style and tone. If in doubt, you can explicitly cite your “exemplar papers”.

Your introduction should also concisely state what your main contributions are. What did you do – did you perform experiments, or conduct a literature review, or something else entirely? (Note that this is the contributions your overall project, not a "contribution statement" that describes literally what each team member did. That will come later!)

Marking scheme: 2 points for clear problem statement. 2 points for a clear high-level description of your main contribution (from the Introduction, I should have a general sense of what you did, and I’ll get the details in Methods).

**Related work: 4 points**

You should conduct a reasonable literature review of related work. You may want to make use of tools like Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar. This does not need to be restricted to peer-reviewed academic works or class readings. You can, and should, cite anything that helped you work on the project or serves as a point of comparison, including software libraries on GitHub, pre-prints on arXiv, blog posts from ML researchers, etc. You should be able to find 3-4 references that you engage with closely, at least one of which is an academic work and itself provides upstream / "classics" in the subfield of your choice. 

Marking scheme: 2 points for selecting relevant references. 2 points for clear description of their relevance (so, you can get 2 points if you literally just list references, and the remaining two come from your prose).

**Methods / What you did: 4 points**

You should describe what you did. You are encouraged to find and cite an exemplar paper in order to help you structure your Methods section.

This section will vary heavily amongst different project types.

If you are unable to find an exemplar paper, please let me know\!

Marking scheme: 

- 2 points for a clear description of what you did and justification for it.  
  - e.g. just saying “I used sklearn” will not earn marks – you should specify the model you used, how you selected hyperparameters, etc.  
  - e.g. just saying “I select this model because it’s popular” will not earn marks – you should specify the criteria you considered for selecting a model  
- 2 points for appropriateness of methods choice
  - e.g., if you said your goal is to explore recommender systems but you only did experiments with image classification, you will not earn marks

**Results / What you produced: 4 points**

This section will also vary quite a bit based on your project. You are encouraged to find and cite an exemplar paper here, as well.

Marking scheme: 

- “Results” will vary heavily, so this rubric will lend most to the “simulated reviewer” approach. Your results section should aim to “fulfill the promise” of your methods. If you said you will use a particular evaluation approach, you should provide the relevant data here and describe the insights from that data.  
- For this section in particular, you may send in any early draft if you’re unclear about whether you need to get “more” results.

**Discussion: 8 points**

You can earn up to 8 points for discussing the implications of your project and especially potential lines of future work that incorporate a data-centric or human-centric lens. This section has a large point total because it is your change to show your engagement with course materials and concepts. You do not need to *only* discuss course readings or quote from course materials, but to earn a high score you should demonstrate engagement with course themes. 

Here, you are welcome to disagree with course materials. Perhaps your project results have tension with claims made in our readings. If so, you can describe them here (this is one aspect of your project report that you may wish to edit before sharing, as this “disagreement” may make less sense outside of the course project).

Marking scheme: 

- 8 points for extremely in depth engagement – your writing here suggests you have deeply understood and considered key ideas from our readings and discussions, and were able to apply these effectively to concrete context  
  - E.g. you highlight benefits (or challenges\!) that arise from applying abstract concepts in our readings to a real application area. Your discussion section would be a great starting point for a research publication or for a blog post about your software.  
- 6 points for good level of engagement  
  - E.g., It is obvious you have done the course readings, but some discussion points may be unconvincing or shoehorned in.  
- 4 points for reasonable engagement  
  - E.g.. You cite HCML and an online platforms-related reading and mainly summarize some points from those articles  
- 2 points for last ditch effort  
  - E.g., You throw together a paragraph or two that mention human and data-centric AI, but I am not convinced you can describe key concepts.

**Connection to class themes: 4 points**

Between 0 and 4 points. Outside of your discussion, does your project show engagement with some of the frameworks for thinking we've discussed in the class? If I saw this project in your portfolio, would it give me confidence in your ability to work on "human-centered" or "data-centered" projects?

Marking scheme:

- If you have discussed this with me before, you should earn 4 marks for this category.  
- If not, I will mark on a scale of "very connected" to "very much not connected".

**Overall artifact quality: 8 points**

You will also earn points for producing high quality artifacts \-- this might be code, UI design mock-ups, an actual interface, or a very well formatted report.

You should include at the end of your report a contribution statement describing specifically how each group member contributed to each section of the project and each artifact.

You will also turn in (via zip file or web link) your project "components" (code, other artifacts, etc.). You are encouraged to create a public GitHub repository and just put the link in your report PDF. This will make it easier to share with others as well.

Marking scheme:

- 8/8: a stunning artifact that I am thrilled to share with my colleagues  
- 4/4: decent effort. Not my first choice to show off to my colleagues.  
- 0/4: extremely low effort.

Note that I don’t expect everyone to produce an 8/8 quality (nor do you need to: if you get 36/40 on your report, 90% on all quizzes, and 90% on all assignments, you can still easily get a great grade).

### **What do I turn in?**

Required: a report as PDF.

Optional: include a web link to your project materials (e.g. a GitHub link).

Optional: include a zip file with project materials.

Optional: Present your project during the final week of class.
